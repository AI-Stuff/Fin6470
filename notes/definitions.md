# Some Notes on Economic Equilibrium Concepts

From the [Dictionary of Financial Engineering](DFE):

- ___Arbitrage___: Simultaneously transacting in two or more markets in order to earn a profit from a price discrepancy between the two markets. The arbitrage can be across markets separated by space (geographical or
  spatial arbitrage), across time (temporal arbitrage), across tax rates (tax arbitrage), or across the structural components of the assets traded. In its purest form, arbitrage is risk free and requires no investment of the arbitrageur's own capital. Real world arbitrage, however, is rarely completely risk free and often requires considerable capital for infrastructure. 

- ___Arbitrage Free___: A situation in which an arbitrageur cannot make a profit because the two instruments are not mispriced relative to one another. Sometimes understood to mean an efficient market. Alternatively, the absence of arbitrage opportunities. 

- ___Efficient Markets Hypothesis___: A theory that holds that all competitive markets price assets correctly in the sense that, at any given point in time, the market price accurately reflects the relevance of all available information. The theory was first formally put forward by Eugene Fama in 1970, but others had alluded to the underlying premise much earlier. 

- ___Law of One Price___: An equilibrium relationship that is enforced by arbitrage. The law states that the prices of the same commodity offered in two different markets should never differ by more than the cost of transporting the commodity between the two markets (after adjusting for the exchange rate between two markets if the prices are denominated in different currencies). Violations of the law of one price can indicate barriers to trade. 

- ___Transactions Costs___: The costs associated with engaging in a financial transaction. These include explicit costs (such as commissions and front-end fees) and indirect costs (such as bid-ask spread and market impact costs). Market impact costs, sometimes called __slippage__, are included when large transactions move the price unfavorably for the party trying to buy or sell.

From the [Oxford Dictionary of Economics](ODE): 

- ___Auctioneer___: 1. In practical usage, the auctioneer manages the bidding process in an auction. 2. As a theoretical construct, the auctioneer is a fictitious device to explain the determination of equilibrium prices in a competitive economy in which no firm or consumer has price-setting power. 

- ___Aribrage___: Buying a good or asset in one market and simultaneously selling in another market where the price is higher. This earns a profit (the difference between the two prices) but does not involve taking any risk. In a financial market arbitrage can involve short-selling one asset, or portfolio, and using the funds to purchase another.  Provided the assets (or portfolios) have the same return and risk characteristics this is risk-free. Arbitrage tends to prevent the price of the same good or asset in different markets moving further apart than a margin equal to transactions costs. Interest arbitrage is borrowing in a market with lower interest rates and simultaneously lending in a market with higher ones. __See also__ NO ARBITRAGE.

- ___Law of One Price___: The proposition that where the same good or asset is traded in different markets, the prices will not diverge. If prices do diverge, a profit can be made by arbitrage, that is buying in the cheaper market and selling in the dearer. This assumes that information about both prices is available, and that goods or assets can be transferred freely between the markets. By extension, the law of one price can be taken to imply that where there are costs of transferring goods or assets, prices will not diverge by more than the transfer costs; they may of course diverge less than this. The application of this law to goods markets in inhibited by the fact that transfer of goods between markets takes time as well as money.

- ___No Arbitrage___: The absence of opportunities to earn a risk-free profit with no investment. The essential idea of arbitrage is the purchase of a good in one market and the immediate resale, at a higher price, in another market. If
  both the purchase and sale prices are known then the resulting profit is risk free. The absence of arbitrage ensures that markets are in equilibrium. The concept of arbitrage has been extended to financial markets. In a financial market an arbitrage portfolio involves going short in some assets and long in others, with the portfolio having zero net cost but a positive expected return. No arbitrage means that no such portfolio can be constructed, and so asset prices are in equilibrium. 

- ___Price mechanism___: An expression referring to the role of prices in a market economy in conveying information, providing incentives, guiding choices, and allocating resources. The 'market mechanism' is an alternative phrase making the same point. The prices people are willing to pay for goods and services convey information about how much they value them, and the prices producers ask convey information about how their inputs are valued. The price mechanism provides incentives to allocate resources where their value is highest, and to satisfy wants from the cheapest sources.
