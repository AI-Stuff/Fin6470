## Notes from Lecture 1

Today's discussion was wide-ranging on the concept of arbitrage. It's going to be a fun semester. See some notes and links below for your general interest (some of which we will delve deeper into later).

Most lectures following will be much more focused, but if you at all you'll be able to get me off track!


### Arbitrage

### Morality & Arbitrage

* My own humble take: https://broughtj.github.io/Morality-of-Arbitrage/morality-slides.html#1

* Richard Swinburne tries to use arbitrage (in the form of a [Dutch book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_book)) to prove the [existence of God](https://www.amazon.com/Epistemic-Justification-Richard-Swinburne/dp/0199243794/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1484088579&sr=1-1&keywords=epistemic+justification)
* Colin Howson tries to use arbitrage to prove the [non-existence](https://www.amazon.com/Objecting-God-Colin-Howson/dp/052118665X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1484088625&sr=8-1&keywords=objecting+to+god) of God
* Q: what is the arbitrage? They can't both be right, can they?!
* Stephen Unwin calculates the [probability of God](https://www.amazon.com/Probability-God-Simple-Calculation-Ultimate/dp/1400054788/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1484088696&sr=8-1&keywords=the+probability+of+God) to be precisely 78%!


* C.S. Lewis had a lot to say about morality (does what he writes/says have anything to do with arbitrage?)
	- https://www.amazon.com/Mere-Christianity-C-S-Lewis/dp/0060652926/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1484088464&sr=8-2&keywords=mere+christianity] (see chapters 1 - 5 in particular)

	- He even had some thoughts about [economics](https://tifwe.org/resource/c-s-lewis-and-the-meaning-of-freedom/) and political economy

* Folks at The Rolling Stone think that capitalism and arbitrage are a [great vampire squid](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-great-american-bubble-machine-20100405)

	
### Information Systems

* Accoring to Hayek markets are in fact [information systems](http://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/hykKnw1.html)!

[Is Computer Science about arbitrage too?](http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/2030000/2020604/p1307-chen.pdf?ip=129.123.19.142&id=2020604&acc=ACTIVE%20SERVICE&key=B63ACEF81C6334F5%2E200FC572085D8E36%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35&CFID=887362357&CFTOKEN=89178781&__acm__=1484091022_76fc0ade4db007ce23e78370acc0bcb9)

Come on, Brough? Is the internet really all just about arbitrage?! Anybody want to do a Plan B on the subject to find out?


### Mathematics and its effectiveness

* Mathematics is [deeply mysterious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler's_identity). When I saw that these three seemingly disparate parameters - each totally weird in their own right - had such crazy deep connections to each other my mind exploded!

* The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences:
