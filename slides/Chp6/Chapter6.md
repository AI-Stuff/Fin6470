# Section 6.1 Introduction to Commodity Forwards 

## Introduction to Commodity Forwards

- Commodity forward prices can be described by the same formula as that for financial forward prices

\begin{equation*}
 F_{0,T} = S_{0} e^{(r - \delta)T}
\end{equation*}


## Introduction to Commodity Forward (Cont'd)

- For financial assets, $\delta$ is the dividend yield

- For commodities, $\delta$ is the commodity lease rate
	* The lease rate is the return that makes an investor willing to buy and then lend a commodity
	* The lease rate for a commodity can typically be estimated only by observing the forward prices


## Introduction to Commodity Forward (Cont'd)

- Differences between commodities and financial assets include
	* Storage costs
	* Carry markets
	* Lease rate
	* Convenience yield


## Introduction to Commodity Forward (Cont'd)

- The set of prices for different expiration dates for a given commodity is called the __forward rate__ (or the
  __forward strip__) for that date

- If on a given date the forward curve is upward sloping, then the market is in __contango__. If the forward curve is
  downward sloping, the market is in __backwardation__
	* Note that forward curves can have portions in backwardation and portions in contango


# Section 6.2 Equilibrium  Pricing of Commodity Forwards 

## Equilibrium Pricing of Commodity Forwards

- As with financial forwards, the commodity forward price is a biased estimate of the expected spot price, $E(S_{T})$,
  with the bias due to the risk premium on the commodity, $r - \alpha$. (___NB___: $r - \alpha = -(\alpha - r)$).

\begin{equation*}
 F_{0,T} = E_{0}(S_{T})e^{-(\alpha - r)T}
\end{equation*}

- As with financial forwards, the commodity forward price is a biased estimate of the expected spot price,
  $E_{0}(S_{T})$, with the bias due to the risk premium on the commodity, $r - \alpha$. (Note that $r - \alpha =
  -(\alpha - r)$)

\begin{equation*}
 F_{0,T} = E_{0}(S_{T})e^{-(\alpha - r) T}
\end{equation*}


## Equilibrium Pricing of Commodity Forwards (Cont'd)

- Different commodities have their distinct forward curves, reflecting different properties of
	* Storability
	* Storage costs
	* Production
	* Demand
	* Seasonality
